# Barless

Remove gesture bar but keep the system and keyboard gap

## Compatibility

Android 10 AOSP roms only

## Why?

My home bar got burned in so I wanted to get rid of it to prevent any further damage but I hated that other modules moved the keyboard down and made it hard to type.

## Thanks

Thanks to DanGLES3 for the base module.
